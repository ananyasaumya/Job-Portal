# Job-Portal
A Job Portal built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to post and search for jobs, manage profiles, and apply for openings. Employers can create job listings and manage applications, while job seekers can search for jobs, apply, and track their applications.
